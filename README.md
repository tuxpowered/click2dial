==========

Click 2 Dial script for asterisk pbx. 

This will create an asterisk .call file for each call you wish to make.
The script is expected to run on the local asterisk system. 
* Future versions may have AMI hooks.

The script can be called from the CLI for testing, or called from web app.

Currently I run this script on a WSGI webservice that simply calls out to the script.

I will be sure to upload samples of this in the future.
